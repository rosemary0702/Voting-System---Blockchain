# Voting-System---Blockchain
This project was developed to create a voting system using blockchain concepts, for the VAC Block Chain and Cryptocurrency course.

There are separately declared variables, modifiers and functions. In this system smart contract are to decide the decision of any proposal. There are three stages: first is starting the voting, then the voting begins and then voting ends. The total votes can only be viewed only after the voting process is entirely completed, this is done by making the total votes private. The outputs that are generated are total votes and the total voters
